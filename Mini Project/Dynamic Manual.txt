			Welcome to the Dynamic Manual...


      1. Overview:-


	(i). Addition:-
	        This module can add up positive real numbers upto any range. You just in need to produce the numbers in a proper mathematical format and don't need to mention anything, i.e., you neither need to produce the range neither the type of value.
	Sample Ex:
	        Enter the first number : 3656897867698769876
	        Enter the second number : 3644876398768975.3687968
	        Your answer is : 3660542744097538851.3687968


	(ii). Subtraction:-
	        This module can subtract any two positive real numbers upto any range. You just in need to produce the numbers in a proper mathematical format and don't need to mention anything, i.e., you neither need to produce the range neither the type of value.
	Sample Ex:
	        Enter the first number : 3656897867698769876
	        Enter the second number : 3644876398768975.3687968
	        Your answer is : 36532522991300000900.6312032


	(iii). Multiplication:-
	        This module can multiply any two positive real numbers upto any range. You again like the other two just need to represent the numbers in a proper mathematical format and don't need to mention anything. The code automatically detects the type, range and precision of each value.
	Sample Ex:
	        Enter the first number : 3656897867698769876
	        Enter the second number : 3644876398768975.3687968
	        Your answer is : 133289...986

      2. Rules, Exceptions and Assumptions:-


	(i). Addition:-
	      -> Just write the numbers in any proper mathematical order.
	      -> You always need to write the decimal values less than 1 as '0.' precision.
	      -> The result will always be displayed in the largest dp format, as per norms of normal algebra.
	      -> Press an Enter key after you have finished typing the number.
	      -> You cannot press any characters other than 0-9.
	      -> You cannot press more than one dot.

	(ii). Subtraction:-
	      -> Just write the numbers in any proper mathematical order.
	      -> You always need to write the decimal values less than 1 as '0.' precission.
	      -> The result will always be displayed in the largest dp format, as per norms of normal algebra.
	      -> Press an Enter key after you have finished typing the number.
	      -> You cannot press any characters other than 0-9.
	      -> You cannot press more than one dot.

              (iii). Multiplication:-

	      -> You cannot press more than one dot.

              (iv). Default:-
	      -> In the common module just press your respective values and it will be generated. You donot need to press the Enter key for an input.
             	      -> A new window will open according to your respective choice.
	      -> To quit from any window just press the Q button presnt in the keyboard device of the console.
